// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var fullName = ["Misbah", "Maryam", "Bushra"];
// for( let i = 0; i< fullName.length; i++){
//     console.log(`Hello,${fullName[i]}! Have a great day.`);
// }
var message = "do you like some coffee?";
console.log(fullName[0] + message);
