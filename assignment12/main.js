// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
var transportation = ["Tesla Model S", "Porsche 911", "BMW M5"];
for (var i = 0; i < transportation.length; i++) {
    console.log("I would like to own a " + transportation[i]);
}
